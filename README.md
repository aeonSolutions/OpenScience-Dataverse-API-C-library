**I start working again on this project later this year in 2024**. In the meantime looking for sponsors to pay for the required work necessary for the successful completion of this project. 

This is a C++-based library intended for embedded firmware development, however, it can be easily ported and made compatible with any platform or operating system. see the [WIKI](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/OpenScience-Dataverse-API-C-library/wiki) for more information.

<br>

The Dataverse Project is an open-source web application to share, preserve, cite, explore, and analyze research data. It facilitates making data available to others and allows you to replicate others' work more easily. Researchers, journals, data authors, publishers, data distributors, and affiliated institutions all receive academic credit and web visibility. Funded by Harvard University and Powered by Open Scholar.

**Dataverse API in another coding language**

Goto dataverse.org for another coding language that best suits your coding style and needs. Currently, there are client libraries for Python, Javascript, R, Java, and Julia that can be used to develop against Dataverse Software APIs

## Instalation & usage

To learn how to install and use this library, goto the wiki page [here](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/OpenScience-Dataverse-API-C-library/wiki) or by clicking on the top menu.

There's an ongoing research project to develop a "[Proof of Concept of a Smart DAQ Device able to Upload Live Experimental Sensor Data to a Data Repository with a Unique Data Fingerprint](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/openScienceResearch-Smart-DAQ-Device-able-to-Upload-Live-Experimental-Sensor-Data-to-a-Data-Repo)"  that discusses an innovative proof-of-concept method for management of collected experimental data in real-time and compatible with any open environment. The proposed proof-of-concept smart DAQ device has the minimum hardware characteristics to handle data measurements collection from sensors locally connected to it, store it on a local CSV or SQLite database file and finally connect and synchronize data measurements collected with a data repository hosted remotely on a Dataverse.

## For developers and Dataverse Repositories
Report issues and contribute to dataverse.org's code: Report bugs and add feature requests in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues) or use [GitHub pull requests](http://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/developers/version-control.html#how-to-make-a-pull-request), if you have some code, scripts or documentation that you'd like to share. If you have a security issue to report, please email [security@dataverse.org](mailto:security@dataverse.org).

Ask a question or start a discussion: Great place to publicly share feedback, ideas, feature requests, and troubleshoot any issues is in the [Dataverse Users Community](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dataverse-community).

Join #dataverse on [chat.dataverse.org](http://chat.dataverse.org/) to chat with the Dataverse community in real time, or leave a message that will be logged at https://view.matrix.org/alias/%23dataverse:matrix.org

## Academic Credit & Best Practices
By depositing data into a Dataverse repository, which can be customized or embedded into a website with Dataverse.org's [Theme + Widgets](http://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/user/dataverse-management.html?#general-information) feature, researchers make their datasets more discoverable to the scientific community. [Widgets](http://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/user/dataverse-management.html?#general-information) are available at the Dataverse collection and dataset level and can be embedded in any website to help others find a scholar's datasets more easily.

By increasing research data's visibility with the Dataverse Project, researchers can get recognition and proper academic credit for their scholarly work through a [data citation](https://dataverse.org/best-practices/data-citation). These citations also help ensure that when research data is published, funder and publisher requirements are met, and data is reused by other scholars, replicated for verification, and tracked to measure usage and impact over time, which can help fund future research.


A data citation in a Dataverse repository has seven components:
- author name(s)
- year (date published in the Dataverse repository)
- title
- global persistent identifier: [DOI](http://www.doi.org/) or [Handle](http://handle.net/)
- publisher (repository that published the dataset)
- version number
- [universal numerical fingerprint](http://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/developers/unf/index.html) (UNF): for tabular data

Here is an example of a replication data citation from Political Analysis, Hanmer, Banks, and White, 2013:


> Hanmer, Michael J.; Banks, Antoine J., White, Ismail K., 2013, "Replication data for:
> Experiments to Reduce the Over-reporting of Voting: A Pipeline to the Truth",
> [doi:10.7910/DVN/22893](http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/22893), Harvard Dataverse, V2, UNF:5:eJOVAjDU0E0jzSQ2bRCg9g==
